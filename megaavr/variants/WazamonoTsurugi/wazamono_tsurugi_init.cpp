/* wazamono_tsurugi_init.cpp - board-specific hardware init for Wazamono Tsurugi
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Part of WazamonoCore (a product-specific fork of SpenceKonde/DxCore).
 * (C) Workshop Asahi 2026.  DxCore is (C) Spence Konde, LGPL 2.1 (see LICENSE.md).
 *
 * Purpose
 *   Drive the on-board LED from PC3 while mirroring D13 (PD6, the SPI SCK pin) in
 *   hardware, so the LED never loads the SCK line.  This replaces the unity-gain
 *   op-amp buffer that a classic Arduino Uno R3 puts between pin 13 (SCK) and its
 *   LED.  The mirror is a pure hardware path - zero CPU, and it tracks PD6 whether
 *   PD6 is driven by digitalWrite(13, ...) or by the SPI peripheral (SCK):
 *
 *     PD6 pin level --(PORTD EVGEN0)--(EVSYS CH0)--> CCL LUT1 IN0 (EVENTA)
 *                   --> LUT1 truth-table = buffer --> LUT1-OUT = PC3 --> LED
 *
 *   LUT1's input pins (PC0..PC2) are not bonded on the AVR64DU32 VQFN32, but that
 *   does not matter: the input is taken from the event channel, and LUT1's OUTPUT
 *   pin (PC3) IS bonded.  Per the datasheet PORTMUX CCLROUTEA table, LUT1's default
 *   output position is PC3, so no CCLROUTEA change is needed.
 *
 * Datasheet references (DS40002548A)
 *   - PORTMUX 17.3.2 (CCLROUTEA): LUT1 default OUT = PC3, IN0..IN2 = none.
 *   - CCL 30.2.2.1 (INSEL): IN0 = EVENTA selects EVSYS event channel A.
 *   - EVSYS: PORTD EVGENn pin-level generator; channel generator code for
 *     PORTD EVGEN0 = 0x40 | (port<<1) = 0x40 | (3<<1) = 0x46.
 *   - PORT EVGENCTRL: EVGEN0SEL picks which PORTD pin feeds EVGEN0 (6 = PD6).
 *
 * IMPORTANT (VUSB power domain)
 *   PC3 is in the VUSB power domain, so its output buffer is only powered while the
 *   USB voltage regulator is enabled.  The LED therefore lights only while the board
 *   is USB-powered / enumerated - it will NOT light at power-on before the USB stack
 *   brings up the regulator.  This is expected and is documented for the user.
 *
 * Resource use
 *   Consumes EVSYS channel 0 and CCL LUT1 (and its OUT pin PC3).  Sketches that need
 *   the Event/Logic libraries should avoid EVSYS channel 0 and CCL LUT1.
