/* wazamono_tachi_init.cpp - board-specific init + activity LEDs for Wazamono Tachi
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Part of WazamonoCore (a product-specific fork of SpenceKonde/DxCore).
 * (C) Workshop Asahi 2026.  DxCore is (C) Spence Konde, LGPL 2.1 (see LICENSE.md).
 *
 * Reproduces the Arduino Pro Micro / Leonardo (ATmega32U4) RX/TX activity LEDs:
 *
 *   - RX LED on PD5 (active-LOW, = LED_BUILTIN): lit when CDC data is RECEIVED
 *     (host -> device).
 *   - TX LED on PD4 (active-LOW):                lit when CDC data is SENT
 *     (device -> host).
 *   - Each data event lights the LED and (re)arms a 100-tick one-shot; the USB
 *     Start-of-Frame (~1 ms) decrements the one-shot and turns the LED off when
 *     it expires. Continuous traffic keeps re-arming it (LED stays lit); an idle
 *     link turns the LED off ~100 ms after the last byte.
 *
 * This mirrors the 32U4 core's behaviour (USBCore.cpp: RXLED1/TXLED1 +
 * RxLEDPulse/TxLEDPulse = TX_RX_LED_PULSE_MS(100), decremented in the SOF ISR),
 * reimplemented for WazamonoCore's interrupt-driven USB stack.
 *
 * The clean-room USB stack only calls three board-agnostic hooks
 * (usb_cdc_on_rx_activity / usb_cdc_on_tx_activity / usb_cdc_on_led_tick, weak
 * no-ops by default). All LED/pin knowledge lives here, so Tsurugi - which has
 * no RX/TX LEDs and uses PD4/PD5 as D11/D12 - keeps the no-ops and is untouched.

 * a weak one already provided by a linked object, so without help this entire
 * translation unit (initVariant + the activity-LED hooks below) is silently
 * dropped at link time. boards.txt passes
 *     -Wl,-u,wazamono_tachi_variant_keep
 * which forces the linker to pull this member; once pulled, the strong defs
 * here override the weak defaults. (Confirmed necessary, including under -flto.) */
